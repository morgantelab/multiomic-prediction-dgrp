# Multiomic prediction of complex traits in the DGRP

This repository contains code that was used to perform the analyses in the accompanying paper:
> Leveraging Multiple Layers of Data to Predict Drosophila Complex Traits. <br />
> 2020. Morgante F., W. Huang, P. SÃ¸rensen, C. Maltecca and Trudy F. C. Mackay <br />

We note that this repository is not documented or explicitly designed to be released. 
While most of the codes are specific to the computing cluster at North Carolina State Univeristy, 
we believe they are still useful to show our strategies and specific parameter settings.
Detailed information regarding the analyses and how to obtain the data can be found within the paper.
